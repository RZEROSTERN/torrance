# Torrance
Just a joke for making fun of the butt nuggets who are saying that you should not hire a person if they don't have a full Github timeline. It is based on The Shining's scene what Jack Torrance writes a "book" that only has the following quote:

## "All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy"

## How to play?
1. Fork.
2. Set your SSH keys (if required)
3. Set your cronjob to the sh file

...

PROFIT!
